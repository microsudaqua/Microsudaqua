**Descrição**

SAMO  (South Atlantic Microbial Observatory)  is located in the South Atlantic Ocean, in the marine portion of Laguna de Rocha natural protected  area (DINAMA,  2010). The sampling station (34°42'43.36”S, 54°14'08.64”W) was established as a microbial observatory in 2014, in the frame of an international initiative for microbial life survey,  i.e.  Ocean Sampling Day (Kopf  et al. 2015). The station is 2.3 nautical miles from the coast and close to the 20 m isobath. It is the only aquatic microbial observatory  in Uruguay,  and joined the μSudAqua micro-observatories network  since its beginning in 2017. The μSudAqua  network  is a reference  for  exchange in terms of methodological and conceptual approaches to gather and analyze data on aquatic microbial communities and their environment.  Current  collaborations include flow-cytometry training (starting in 2022 with Fernando Unrein as visiting professor)  and ecological modelling (starting in 2024 with Erick Mateus-Barros as post-doc).  Next year,  in the frame of the recently launched Regional Postgraduate  School in Microbial Ecology of Aquatic Systems, further training will be  achieved with the participation of several researchers and students of the μSudAqua  network.
